## Installation 

Pre-requisite:

- Tested on node:18
- ReactJS - [setup guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-reactjs-on-windows/)

This project consists of 2 seperate folder:
- `client`: React app
- `node-server` (in the future): connect with DB and support CRUD operations

<!-- ### to start node-server
you may want to change MongoDB config [here](node-server\app\config\db.config.js)

```console
cd node-server
npm install
npm start
``` -->

<!-- The server will be listening on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) -->

### to start React app

```console
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
The app will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

you might want to change the `firebase/config` in [this file](./client/src/firebase/config.js)

you might also want to use `firebase emulator` for local dev environment. check out the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_and_prototype)
