## Useful Scripts
 
After you've got the codebase, you may need to install the app's dependencies:
### `npm install`
Wait for the installation to finish. You only need to do this for the first time.
 
You can run the command:
### `npm start`
 
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
 
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
 
In development mode, you might want to host the Firestore locally. For more details, take a look at the document for [Firebase Emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_and_prototype)
### `firebase emulators:start`
 
### `npm build`
 
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
 
The build is minified, the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
